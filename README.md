# Define Analysis Question

Build a regression model that predicts the home team's score for each
match

Build a classifier that predicts whether the home team will win, lose or draw


# Metrics for Success

Performance of the regression models will be determined using the RMSE score.

Classifier accuracy will be determined using the confusion matrix


# Understanding

Football matches and FIFA rankings data has been provided for analysis. As data scientist i have to help them achieve thier results by providing them with best model that accurately predict results
